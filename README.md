Order products by sales - Prestashop module
=============

This module is compatible with Prestashop 1.5+ (tested on 1.5.6 & 1.5.4.1).

This module gives you the ability to sort products by bestsellers instead of default ordering by hand.

You can choose between ordering by number of sales or value of sales (number of sales multiplied by product price - tax excluded). Products that have no recorded sales yet will retain the order you've set by hand. You may also choose to exclude certain categories if you wish to keep the order set by hand in those.
